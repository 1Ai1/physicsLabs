      Takeaways:
    </h2>
    Energy makes changes and movement possible in everyday life<br>Energy is 
    required to enable things to work or move.<br>There are different forms of 
    energy and they can be converted from one form to another.<br>

    <h2>
      Description
    </h2>
    This simulation allow students to explore the concepts of kinetic energy 
    and potential energy. When the re-bounce case is selected, the sum of 
    kinetic energy and potential energy drop immediately after each contact 
    with the ground. The energy loss is typically associated with sound and 
    heat energy loss to the surrounding by the ball.<br>

    <h2>
      Sample Questions that this simulations was made to address
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Sample Learning Goals
    </h2>
    **Recognise and give examples of the various forms of energy. - kinetic 
    energy - potential energy<br>**Investigate energy conversion from one form 
    to another and communicate findings.<br>
